## Description

The Challenge twenty assignment tasked us with creating a tech blog using MVC (Model, Views, Controller). These three design aspects help organzie our code into easy to manage sections. Models handle the form of our data in conjunction with MySQL2. The Views hold our style and HTML in the form of handlebars. This site was built with bootstrap within the HTML. The Controllers handle our routes for each page and provide functionality alongside the public javascript written within the repository.
